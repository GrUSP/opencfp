    <h3>ðŸ”Ž How the conference works:</h3>
    <p>
        You can decide whether to present your talk live or to record it in advance. In any case, we will offer you all
        the technical support you will need!<br>
        Each session includes a short live introduction, your presentation (30 or 45 minutes), the Q&A (about 15 minutes).
        The conference will be accessible only to registered (paid) attendees and will be held on a platform that integrates:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the (virtual) stage, with the live video streaming;</li>
        <li>public and private chat and video-conference rooms;</li>
        <li>expo spaces for sponsors and partners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We've run several digital events and proved that they can be very engaging, people have been interacting
        actively and making connections.
        We don't want the virtual conference to just be a flow of content that people watch passively. We want to create
        a good user experience, obviously different from an in-person event, but likewise engaging, inclusive, and interactive.
